# Find My Past coding challenge
Builded using create-react-app.
Working on the Javascript requirements.

# How to use
App based on create-react-app, so:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the app: `npm start`

# Future work
1. Split data storage and the application itself (the App.js file should contain only the UI of the application, data should be stored somewhere else, like top level component or Redux/MobX store)
2. Write tests (sorry, did not have time for). Basically any state update function in App.js should be tested
3. Restyle. It's pretty ugly now
4. Edit note, Remove note
5. Duplicate note, send the node over email / share on social networks
